this will change the configuration on Pantheon and Gnome Desktop
in order to apply my basic keyboard shortcut

You need also to have wmctrl install otherwise `win + j` will not work properly

this still need some work, especially on `win + j` and `win + m`.

But it's sufficient to survive on a Pantheon or Gnome desktop without struggling
over the migration
